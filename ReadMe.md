  - Level Design
  - Game Balancing
- Game Art Assets
  - Character Sprites and Animations
  - Interactable Object Sprites and Animations
  - Background Tileset

  - Base Engine Setup: updating, static and animated sprite rendering, event and input handling, sound handling, etc.
  - Core Gameplay Functionality Implementation
  - Interaction interface between the level builder (Tiled) and the engine using the Tileson library
  - Toolchain setup and maintenance (level builder Tiled, engine, GitHub repository)
    
- Project Management Toolchain (This repository does not contain a GitHub Wiki; all project management and documentation were done using Atlassian software: Jira & Confluence)
